    "In this homework, we will investigate the comparative magnitudes of advection and diffusion of heat in the ocean. For this exercise, we will rely on output from a model that we have compiled and run in class. If you have not already done so, you will need to compile and run the `global_with_exf` verification experiment according to the steps on the handout from Lecture 8-2.\n",
