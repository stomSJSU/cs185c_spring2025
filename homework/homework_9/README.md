# California Upwelling

In this project, I will investigate the effects of ocean temperature and how it affects the California sea level. 

## Scientific Question

How does ocean temperature affect the sea level along the coast of California?

## Project Description

To investigate, I will research how ocean temperature affects the sea level along the coast of California. Specifically, I will look into thermal expansion and density variations and how they influence sea level. To do this, I will analyze fields such as salinity (SALT), temperature (THETA), sea level, and depth (Bathymetry). For the initial conditions, I will use ECCO Version 5 model to obtain the salinity and temperature data. To further investigate this question, I will use MITgcm as the numerical ocean model to simulate the sea level change to see the response to ocean temperature variation. I will calculate the sea level change by analyzing the change in density caused by ocean temperature. To analyze the results I will use a timeseries to show the changes over time. To visualize the results I will create a movie that will demonstrate the difference between a varying temperature field and a fixed field.
